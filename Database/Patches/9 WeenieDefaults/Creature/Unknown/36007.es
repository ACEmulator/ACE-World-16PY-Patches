	- DirectBroadcast: As you fit the lump into the keyhole, you feel a bone-numbing chill pass through your very soul. A pulling sensation forms in the core of your being, but before it becomes unbearable, you see the "key" shrivel and die. Almost immediately thereafter, the chill fades and then you feel a familiar pulling sensation.
