From there, travel to the Catacombs of Tar'Kelyn, which you will find at 55.7S, 97.5E. Enter the catacombs and find the Sclavus called Tikchti. He has recently stolen an important Mnemosyne from the Dericost. Truly titanic in size, it is the repository of lifetimes of knowledge of Geomancy, the Falatacot, and the 'being' called T'thuun. Take this titanic Mnemosyne from Tikchti and bring it back here to me.
