        - Delay: 0.5, Tell: All that aside. My colleagues left me to rot here in order to collect these Blight-encrusted Black Coral chunks which seem to wash up on this poor excuse for a sandbar.
        - Delay: 0.5, Tell: If you bring me 10 of these coral chunks, I'll happily reward you for them. Saves me from having to run around getting them myself
        - Delay: 0.5, Tell: Oh, don't mind my mask, it keeps out the smell...
