I am not certain precisely where he intended to open a portal to, but the gems were to be a power source. The inscription reads, simply, "Property of Asheron Realaidain," nothing more.
            - Tell: I shall share with you the letter I received. Perhaps it will tell you more about the gem and its uses. I'll also give you this trade note as payment for the gem - I am supposed to retain them, but I can at least offer you fair market value for them.
