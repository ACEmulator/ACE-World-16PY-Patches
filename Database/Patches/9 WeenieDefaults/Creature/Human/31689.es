        QuestSuccess:
            - Tell: Excellent! With all these seeds you have brought me, I should be able to grow many more Sundews! Here, allow me to gift you with a sprout!
            - Delay: 1, Give: Orange Monster Sprout (31674)
            - Delay: 1, Tell: Isn't that the most adorable thing? Now listen carefully -- this plant isn't full grown yet! Before it reaches its full growth it needs to be fed a big meal. Sundews generally prefer meat of some sort, but they will sometimes eat other things as well. You may have to experiment a bit.
            - Delay: 1, DirectBroadcast: Drozer smiles at you fondly.
            - Delay: 1, Tell: A plant like this will really only eat one meal in its lifetime, so choose that meal with care. If you feed your sprout well, you may end up with a truly monstrous Sundew. If that happens, bring it back here and I'll fertilize it for you.
            - Delay: 1, Tell: And remember, if you bring me more seeds, I will cultivate more sprouts for you.
