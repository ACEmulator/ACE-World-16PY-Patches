    - DirectBroadcast: %n smiles at you gently.
    - Delay: 1, Tell: You have done much to help us. Your sacrifice and actions assisted Nuhmudira in her darkest hour and we thank you for those efforts.
    - Tell: If you have not yet done so, seek out Balthazar outside of Lin. He will instruct you on how you may further aid us.
    - Delay: 1, Tell: Housing continues to be provided through a joint effort of the Arcanum and the High Queen. Writs are required for these domiciles. Once you possess a Writ of Refuge, seek out a Covenant Stone and determine what else is needed to purchase your homestead. Also of note are new dwellings that have been opened that offer a more communal living arrangement.
    - Delay: 1, Tell: Here is a list items we will accept in exchange for writs.

QuestFailure: SacrificedNuhmudira
    - DirectBroadcast: The Agent bows their head low and speaks softly.
    - Delay: 1, Tell: Although Nuhmudira has returned to us, we have learned that there is still a way to show your support for her. Outside of Stonehold there is a portal to the dungeon where she was once imprisoned. There you can choose to sacrifice yourself for her or to abandon her to her fate. It is odd that the magic has yet to dissipate.
    - Delay: 1, Tell: If you require writs we will accept any of the items on this list in exchange for a writ. Once you possess a Writ of Refuge, and have satisfied the other requirements for purchasing a home, seek out one of the homestead areas that we have built. If you would rather, you can enjoy living in one of the new dwelling areas that have been established for a more communal living arrangement.
