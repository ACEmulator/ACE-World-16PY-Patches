				TestSuccess:
					- Tell: Ah, so you found some kind of black crystal shard on a Virindi that was hiding among the Tanada? Fascinating. I hadn't counted on Virindi involvement, and they are quite beyond my realm of expertise. I think you should give it to Diyas al-Yat here in Zaikhal. He's able to translate those strange artifacts... Please bring me the translation that he gives you.

											- Tell: Ah! Sayuji Jina told me of you! You helped her investigate the Tanada houses of Earth and Air, did you not? Excellent! I need your help now.
											- Give: 35309
											- Delay: 1, Tell: I was exploring the southern land bridge when I was attacked by a pair of Tanada! But these were strange Tanada, not like the descriptions I've heard from Jina. They killed me and sent me back to my lifestone here in Zaikhal, but before I died I was able to tear this medallion off one of them...
											- Delay: 1, Tell: My camp was at 85.2 S, 4.4 W, and I think they came from the west. I would advise you to search the area and see if you can locate some trace of the Tanada presence... Please bring me back any evidence you might turn up of what has brought the Tanada to that area.
