    - Delay: 1, Motion: Salute
    - Delay: 1, Tell: What? You want a reward? This is no trophy -- this is just a scrap of paper! Bring me some trophy ripped from the hands of our enemies and then I will reward you!

    - Delay: 1, Tell: Ah! Yes! That was where they were headed. Thank you for finding this! Where did you find it?
    - Delay: 1, DirectBroadcast: As Ufet looks over the note, you relate to him how you found it.
    - Delay: 1, Tell: I see. The shreth have always been known to be vicious.
    - Delay: 1, Tell: Thank you for this little bit of information, but I will need something more from you in order to reward you for your efforts.

    - Motion: Ready
    - TurnToTarget
    - Delay: 1, Motion: Salute
    - Delay: 1, Tell: The library seems to be caked in madness and filth. Remnants of a Shadow Bulwark perhaps? Soot-layered tombs and air that maddens.
    - Delay: 1, Tell: Now I see why the Raven Hand sought this place out. There may be artifacts of powerful shadows within.
    - Delay: 1, Tell: It seems, though, that Yalik has done well in guarding the place. This is a hugely important task for one as young as he. I wonder how well he will handle the task in the months to come.
    - Delay: 1, DirectBroadcast: Ufet nearly forgets you in his musing, but quickly returns to the matter at hand.
    - Delay: 1, Tell: I thank you for this. We were right to suspect the Order of the Raven Hand were up to no good. Take this as a reward for your efforts.

    - Delay: 1, AwardLevelProportionalXP: 33%, 0 - 2,500,000
    - Delay: 1, Tell: This came from the Shadow's Garb worn by Rayssid Ibn Alhath? Sadly I know little of the man save for his affinity for ranged weapons.
    - Delay: 1, Tell: It seems only fitting that the reward I give you should reflect that. Take this periapt. May it help guide your shots with accuracy and swiftness.

    - Delay: 1, Tell: Ah, Tiyol's tassel, correct? I had no liking for that contemptuous man. In fact, it would not surprise me at all if he was the first to fall under the sway of the Raven Hand.
    - Delay: 1, Tell: You did the world a great justice by defeating him. And since he was such a vile man, I have no qualms about giving out his belongings.
    - Delay: 1, Tell: Before the group left for the library, many of them entrusted some of their belongings to my care. Primarily items that would be of no use to them in the grasslands and forests north of here.
    - Delay: 1, Tell: Tiyol left this Cowl. Here, take it. I am glad to be rid of his belongings. Surely you will put the Cowl to a more appropriate use.

    - TurnToTarget
    - Delay: 1, Tell: You say Rheth Al' Thok wore this upon his Shadow's Garb? He was a bright man, poised to enter the ranks of the Zaikhal Arcanum. Well... that was before my compatriots offered him a place within our ranks. A shame that he was so easily enticed.
    - Delay: 1, AwardLevelProportionalXP: 33%, 0 - 2,500,000
    - Delay: 1, Tell: Since he joined the ranks of the Zharalim, he was striving to obtain the Shagraka- the casting focus used by many of the Zharalim's sorcerers.
    - Delay: 1, Tell: As he is no longer with us, the focus reserved for his use shall be passed on to you.

    - Tell: Good Day. My name is Ufet, and I am here to organize the defense of Gharu'ndim from the depredations of the renegade Tumeroks.
    - Tell: Queen Elysa has called for volunteers to help investigate the Tumerok training camps near Dryreach. You can pick up a news sheet about this menace from the barkeeper.
    - Delay: 1, Tell: If you have already investigated the camps, and you have some trophy to prove it, I will gladly reward you. I also accept Tumerok insignia.
    - Delay: 1, Motion: Ready
    - Delay: 1, Tell: You'll pardon me if my mind is on other matters today. Several of my comrades have left for a recently discovered library north west of this city, but they have not yet returned.
    - Delay: 1, Tell: I am not usually one to worry, but with all that has happened of late, assassinations, invasions and an increase in cult activity, I can't help but do so.
    - Delay: 1, Tell: I must remain at my station, but if you happen to come across them, please let me know where they are. Any information you find will put my mind at ease.
