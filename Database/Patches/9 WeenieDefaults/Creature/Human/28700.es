                            - Delay: 2.5, Tell: The Red Bull of Sanamar, which you see at the center of town, has been sick for some time. We don't know how to cure it! The only man who might is the bull's old caretaker, a man named Lascare. Well, he left town some time ago. All we know is that he lives off by himself on a lonely hilltop on the island to the northeast. Seek him out, please, and figure out a way to cure the bull!
                QuestFailure:
                    - Delay: 1, Tell: You have served us before, I see. There is another task for you, if you are strong enough for it. The King desires a bauble in the possession of a rogue group of Knights who have left our service. These so-called Knights of Karlun disdain the... physical gifts brought about by the transformation of our own Knights. But they distrust the rebels, too!
                    - Delay: 2, Tell: The leader of the Knights of Karlun possesses a ring that once belonged to the great Karlun, founder of the nation of Viamont. Do whatever you must to gain their trust and take the ring from their Grand Master, a fallen knight named Sir Belfelor. You will probably have to kill Belfelor. Seek them out at 89.0N, 67.6W

                    - Delay: 0.1, Tell: You're new to Sanamar, are you not? If you desire to prove your loyalty to the King, I have a task you may find interesting.
                    - Delay: 1, Tell: The King has been informed of an ancient tome which lies in a ruined underground city. He dispatched a company of knights to the ruins, but they were repelled by the beasts within. The craven dogs spread tales of ghosts and undead before I had them executed for cowardice.
                    - Delay: 1.5, Tell: I need someone to enter the ruins and retrieve this tome. If you do this for me, I may have more tasks for you in the future. Of course, if you fail or otherwise betray me, then I'll have nothing to do with you ever again.
                    - Delay: 2, Tell: You can find the ruins near the outpost of Westwatch at 74.2N 74.2W. I expect to hear from you soon.
                    - Delay: 1.5, Tell: But know this - the Grand Mother of Silyun also seeks this tome. Complete this task for me and she will have nothing more to do with you. Though, why you would want to socialize with those damnable rebels is beyond me.
