It seems the Moarsmen have a number of artifacts, 10 to be precise, displayed in shrines throughout their city. The researchers wish to study these artifacts so that we can learn more about these Blighted Moarsmen.
                    - Delay: 0.5, Tell: Travel to Nyr'leha, the Moarsmen City, South East of Candeth Keep on the Southern Shores of the Direlands and collect all 10 of the artifacts from the shrines. Be careful, the Moarsmen seem to hold great value on these artifacts.
