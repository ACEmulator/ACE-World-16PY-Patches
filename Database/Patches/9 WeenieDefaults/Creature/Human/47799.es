    - Tell: This can't be happening. No, this CAN'T be happening!
    - Delay: 0.5, Tell: The workers have all gathered and they are refusing to return to work without another large increase to their wages.
    - Delay: 0.5, Tell: Not only that, but they are also holding my three little pets hostage to try and force my hand in meeting their demands. My poor babies must be so scared.
    - Give: 47831
    - Delay: 0.5,Tell: Please bring this message to them at my sanctuary located around 22.9N, 37.0W. Hopefully they will accept the offer and return my pets. I must prepare you though.
    - Delay: 0.5,Tell: If they refuse the offer they can be unpredictable and may become violent. They mean well, they are a good group. The pressure of the mob mentality has forced many of the workers to act in such a manner.
    - Delay: 0.5,Tell: Please do your best not to kill the workers. If they are "roughed up" a bit though, they are sure to come to their senses and stop this nonsense.
    - Delay: 0.5,Tell: Convince 10 of the workers to return to work. I bet once several see the errors in their way that the others will follow.
    - Give: 72980, 3
    - Delay: 0.5,Tell: The victims in all this are my poor little pets. A Tusker, an Armoredillo and an Ursuin.
    - Delay: 0.5,Tell: They aren't much for strangers but if you feed them this meat it should make them groggy enough to where you can safely place them back in their cages. I have added a special ingredient to the food to tranquilize them very quickly.
