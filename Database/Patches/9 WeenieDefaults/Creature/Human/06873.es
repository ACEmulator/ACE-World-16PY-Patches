    - Tell: Not bad, nice beer stein too. It reminds me of that time I was in Dryreach.
    - Delay: 2, Tell: I had decided to go on a trip. I was tired of all the sun and relaxation, you know how it is. Anyway, I traveled around for awhile visiting pubs and inns and ended up in Dryreach, where I was astonished to find a wonderful house brew made by my friend Mordomor.
    - Delay: 3, Tell: I decided to spend awhile getting to know the drink better so I went to find the old lifestone NW of town. Yeah, I know there's a new lifestone there, but I didn't know that then. The old lifestone looked broken, but by this time I was heavily in my cups and unconcerned with trivial things.
    - Delay: 3, Tell: Now, I'm going to give you a very important bit of information here. Never ever, under ANY circumstances, bind to a lifestone when you're drunk. And if you have an old faulty wand. And if it looks like the lifestone's broken... especially if it looks like the lifestone is broken. I remember wondering why the lifestone was sparking like that, then why my wand was sparking like that. Then my wand caught fire, shot from my hand and exploded... then things got weird.
    - Delay: 5, Tell: Everything after that is fuzzy, but I remember dying repeatedly. Not something I recommend, but what with all the explosions and electric shocks it seemed like the thing to do. My life flashed before my eyes, at least the part that involved being repeatedly killed and revived by a demented lifestone.
    - Delay: 3, Tell: When I came to I found that the bodies I had left during my reincarnations hadn't died. In fact there were nine copies of myself standing around arguing with each other. I could have sworn that I died more than nine times, but like I said before I was pretty vitae'd up.
    - Delay: 3, Tell: I've heard of similar lifestone malfunctions before. Usually the duplicate is just a creepy standing corpse of sorts that hasn't forgotten how to breathe. In most cases unbinding from your lifestone will return that corpse's lifeforce or vitae back to its owner.
    - Delay: 3, Tell: But to unbind from the lifestone I needed to use the same casting device that I tied to it with. By the time I found one of my wand's splinters in the pocket of my robe I realized the duplicates of me had run off.
    - Delay: 3, Tell: It turned out that each of my copies had a splinter from the wand. I was too weak to get them back myself, so I enlisted the help of adventurers. These good people collected all the splinters of my wand and brought them back to me.
    - Delay: 3, Tell: I heard many stories about my duplicates and I actually grew kind of fond of some of them. It was with a heavy heart that I recrafted my wand and unbound from the lifestone. I haven't heard of them since then. I guess they're all gone...
    - Delay: 3, Tell: I'll always remember the time we spent together that spring.
