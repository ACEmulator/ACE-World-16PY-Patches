                                            - Tell: You may be worth my time... My masters have determined that the dusty, deposed Lord Rytheran is the source of our current troubles with ley lines. If you would make yourself useful to us and to all the humans of Dereth, seek him out in his garden sanctuary.
                                            - Delay: 1, Tell: There is a portal to these gardens located in the midst of the Empyrean Graveyard. We need a mnemosyne from Rytheran, bearing... vital information about a book he once held. Take it from him, by force or coercion, and bring it to me. You will be well rewarded.

    -Tell: Well done! I will not ask how you got this artifact from the hoary old tyrant. But this should contain the information we need to find out what Rytheran did wrong, and what we can do to stop what he has unleashed...
