    - Delay: 1, Tell: Yes, this symbol on the collar is definitely Falatacot. I believe it means "Unity". No actually this marking on the triangle represents a single person or a name. This translates better as "One of Three". Very interesting...

    - TurnToTarget
    - Tell: This is a beautiful gem! Where did you say you found it? In a mud cave on the Vesayen Islands? Not surprising that the moarsmen would hoard items.
    - Delay: 1, Tell: It looks almost like a portal gem. But there is something odd about it. Look at the sides of the gems. Those holes look like pegs could fit into them. Did you find anything that would fit in your journeys?
    - Delay: 1, Tell: Either way, I can tell this item has some significance. I won't keep it from you, just seeing it was enough to tantalize my imagination. Whether you crush it and open a portal with it now, or hold on to it is wholly up to you.

    - Delay: 1, Tell: This clasp looks like it is hinged, and it has a pair of carved pegs. This was pulled from some muck you say? Others have come by to show me a gem that they recovered that this artifact may very well fit around. I suggest you find one if you can and see if it fits.
    - Delay: 1, Tell: Hmmm... as I think about it, this object may also have the makings of an interesting piece of jewelry. If only you had the right kind of string, perhaps you might be able to make it wearable.

Refuse: Amethyst Cradle (27765)
    - TurnToTarget
    - Tell: What a remarkable finding! This appears to be a cradle for some sort of item. I recall in my travels of Ispar that the Aluvians would make similar objects to place curious or small decorative statues into.
    - Delay: 1, Tell: Several people have visited me recently with an object that could very well be placed in this. They said they made the gem by combining a pair of items they found on the Vesayen Islands. I recommend exploring the islands further if you haven't already.
    - Delay: 1, Tell: The stone glows, but it looks very fragile. I wonder if it could be powdered and if the powder could be used to enchant a piece of jewelry. But don't take my word for it. What you do with this artifact is your decision and not mine.

    - Delay: 1, Tell: Now that I think of it, several people have come by with a piece of artwork that may very well fit on top of this. They said they got that item from somewhere on the Vesayen Islands, though they were very secretive about where it was they pulled their treasure from.
    - Delay: 1, Tell: Another thing to note is the weight and sound of the dais. It feels very light for being make out of stone, and it sounds like it could be hollow. I see no hinges or doors, perhaps you should take this to Hiro outside of Xarabydun, he may know how to open this casing.
    - Delay: 1, Tell: But don't take my word for it. Either keep it or take it to Hiro. The choice is yours.

    - Delay: 1, Tell: We also know that the Moarsmen, the swamp dwelling creatures that were discovered when portals to the Vesayen Islands first opened, have some sort of connection to them. The Adjanites frequently kept them, though we are not exactly certain why.
    - Delay: 1, Tell: I would enjoy the opportunity to learn more about them, but I honestly have very little time outside of my translator duties to devote to researching the moarsmen.
    - Delay: 1, Tell: I know! Since you are here, would you mind going back to the Vesayen Islands and look for information for me? I can't leave this building, but I can read as much as I want!

Give: Muddy Tome (27791)
    - TurnToTarget
    - Tell: This book appears to be a text regarding the eating habits of the Moarsmen and some creature call the Moars. I am unfamiliar with what the Moar are exactly, but it seems there is some relation between them and the Moarsmen.
    - Delay: 1, Tell: Unfortunately, the text is in horrible condition and I am unable to translate it completely. The best I can do is create a summary of the bits I understand.
    - Delay: 1, Tell: Since you have helped me further my understanding of the Moarsmen and the Falatacot, I will help you.

Give: Decaying Tome (27787)
    - TurnToTarget
    - Tell: This book appears to be a text regarding the hunting habits of the Moarsmen and what seems to be their less advance counterparts, the Moar. The text claims them to be vicious hunters, always on the roam.
    - Delay: 1, Tell: The years have not been kind to this text. There are so many pages that I simply cannot comprehend because of their poor condition. The best I can do for this tome is to create a summary of the legible bits.
    - Delay: 1, Tell: Since you have helped me further my understanding of the Moarsmen and the Falatacot, I will help you.

Give: Filthy Tome (27789)
    - TurnToTarget
    - Tell: Finally! Something with substance. As much as I enjoyed reading about the Moarsmen, those tomes pale compared to this one. This looks to be a history of the Moarsmen on Dereth. Hmm... this also seems to only be one part of the history. A second tome may contain the conclusion of the account.
    - Delay: 1, Tell: Sadly, the pages dissolve as I attempt to read them, so I was only able to construct a high level summary. The finer details of the text were gone before I could transcribe them.
    - Delay: 1, Tell: Since you have helped me further my understanding of the Moarsmen and the Falatacot, I will help you.
    - Give: History of the Moars on Dereth, Part I (27788)

Give: Rotting Tome (27785)
    - TurnToTarget
    - Tell: Had I not seen the first piece of this text, I would have had difficult understanding the context of it. This is the second part of history of the moarsmen on Dereth. Very interesting indeed.
    - Delay: 1, Tell: It is a shame that there were no better reproductions of this tome where ever it was you procured this. I will do my best to summarize it, but the text is very difficult to read through the mud caked pages.
    - Delay: 1, Tell: Since you have helped me further my understanding of the Moarsmen and the Falatacot, I will help you.
    - Give: History of the Moars on Dereth, Part II (27784)

Give: Blackened Tome (27783)
    - TurnToTarget
    - Tell: This is a refreshing change of pace. I have been receiving so many ancient texts that resemble encyclopedias. This appears to be the story of a young Falatacot Priestess and the Falatacot's first encounter with the Moar.
    - Delay: 1, Tell: This story seems to be written in a confusing poetic style. Many of the concepts and actions are interposed, which make it difficult for even a scholar to discern. I will do my best to simplify it into a form that we can easily understand.
    - Delay: 1, Tell: Since you have helped me further my understanding of the Moarsmen and the Falatacot, I will help you.

    - Tell: I am a scholar of the Empyrean culture that lived in the ruins found throughout the swamps and even the desert.  They were apparently called the Falatacot.  If you have a text of that culture, I may be able to help you.
