At first, I declined to provide any details as to the thief''s appearance.

No, quite the contrary. The reason they did not believe me is because my reputation is that of a man who always nets his quarry.

So I mounted an expedition into the Thrungus hovels. It took me a few nights of searching before I found them. But eventually, I uncovered the abandoned ruins wherein the Thrungum make their home.
