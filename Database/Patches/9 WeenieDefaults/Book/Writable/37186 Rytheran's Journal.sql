As a leader of the Winds from Darkness, it seemed an irresistible opportunity to me, to grasp true world-altering power and to feel it bend to my will. So I agreed to open a single page of the Book of Eibhil and use the terrible power contained with its maddening runes to inflict eternal torment upon the enemies of my eternal King. I confess that I saw an opportunity to grasp more power for myself, as well. I was so caught up in the possibilities, I was blinded, as I rarely am, to the consequences. ')

We have watched the struggles of the Yalain and laughed at their over-reaching, even as we mourned our own lands that fell to the insect plague that they unleashed. We have sneered at the mortal minions of the last Yalain even as our most treasured bastions surrendered their secrets to these ubiquitous creatures. It may have been too long since we, the First-Born, felt the humiliation of over-reaching and realized ourselves to be but minor pieces in a game larger than we can comprehend. ')

So adept have I become at whispering destructive temptation into the dreams of mortal fools that I did not recognize, until too late, that I was fooled by the whispered blandishments of the Old Ones.

There will be a crack in the invisible lines through which flow the Blood of the World that the primal chaos at the core of the world will exploit.

I must prepare them for the fight that is inevitable. They are good and loyal servants, and deserving of a better master. ');
