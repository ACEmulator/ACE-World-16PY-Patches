This humble servant presents an account to your lordship of our first contact with the being known only as the Spear of Mukkir.

My Lord''s knights and captains came across the beast laying upon the south western shores of Killiakti, within viewing sight of the indulgent Yalain retreat. For days, the beast slept fitfully, snarling and speaking in an unrecognizable tongue. We were completely at a loss for what it was')

A fortnight of agitated slumber gave way to a shocking awakening. No sooner had one of our scholars arrived (one whose focus was the recorded history of the Haebrous empire), than had the beast laid waste to a dozen of our bravest skeletons. However, the beast was weakened, hungry, and found no sustenance in our fleshless warriors. It was rapidly subdued')

From his short time with the beast (meaning the few hours before it turned on the scholar, shattered his chest and ate the scholar''s desiccated heart), we were informed that it was the fabled beast known as the Spear of Mukkir. Our records show that such a being once existed in the lands of Haebrous, though its appearance was more akin to a heavily muscled Haebrean than the scaled creature it now was.')

As time led on, the Spear of Mukkir gathered an army of slaves and fought their way from the pits and savaged the kingdom, killing many, including Braletain''s young wife, Queen Carraida. Days of pillaging and savagery reigned over the city until, without warning or notice, the Spear of Mukkir disappeared.')
