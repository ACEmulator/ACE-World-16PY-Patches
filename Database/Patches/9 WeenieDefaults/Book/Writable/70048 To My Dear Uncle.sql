I do not know how to respond to your last correspondence. You know that I am incapable of such deeds. For good or ill, the man is my king. I have sworn loyalty to him and his house. The fact that we are no longer on Ispar does not change that fact.

And you must remember, one of the oaths I swore was to bring you to justice, dear uncle. My heart does grieve when I contemplate the day when I will meet you in battle.')

Uncle, this will be my last letter to you. Though I am the King''s loyal subject, and I have rejected every effort of yours to sway me to your cause, even these letters would be enough to mark me a traitor to the realm. No, this correspondence cannot continue. Should you choose to deliver future letters to me, I will burn them unread. Should you send me messengers under cover of night,')

But I do not want my last words to you to be in anger. No, I would remind you of happier times, of a time when we were still family. Do you remember, uncle, our last trip to Silveran? Of course you do, that is a silly question.

I often think back to that trip, the months we spent in those frigid isles, marveling at the wonders of those strange people.')

Such a love the two of you shared. Though you only saw one another every three years, I never once saw your love falter. It must have been difficult. I cannot imagine being parted from my dear Caprice for even a fortnight. And I cannot imagine the pain your wife must have endured being separated from her child for so long. Did you ever tell her? Did Eleonora ever know that her mother was a princess of the Silveran people?')

That was a wonderful time, my uncle - the happiest of my life. When I think of you, that is what I think of. I do not think on your actions toward our King. I do not think of the war which we fight. I think of our journeys to the north. And I hope that when you think of me, that is what you remember as well.

I love you, my uncle. And I hope we do not meet again.');
