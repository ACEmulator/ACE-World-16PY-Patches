I must admit that I am somewhat impressed with my resourcefulness. I scavenged through the debris littered about the gut of the leviathan and happened across a scepter. It possessed just enough magic to strike a flame upon the corroding drift wood

Strange trees the likes of which I have never seen. Niffis shells, as well as the shell of creatures I have never seen before, lay scattered across the land.

The Mosswarts have driven me from their village and I am now lost. I''ve found this temple, but I cannot stay here.

Their efforts have doubled and the doors bend under the stress of their attacks. My treated kits cannot fix the concussion I have, merely treat my scrapes and bruises. There is not hope of surviving this I am afraid.
