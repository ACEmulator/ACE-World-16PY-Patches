I will admit that the Archons succeeded in turning the simple Mattekar into a far more formidable creature, but they failed to impart the loyalty and intelligence needed to make them a truly devastating weapon for the armies of the Emperor. They may indeed be powerful enough to destroy the Lugians, but until we can properly control them, they are little more than a failed experiment.')

Simple, deadly constructs that actively drain the very life-force from their adversaries. It is unfortunate that the Archons failed to keep the Bloodstone facility hidden. They seem to have mastered the art of being too useful to be killed, while also being too inept to truly succeed. I do not know what His Eternal Splendor sees in them. I guess I will have to trust in his judgement where the Archons are concerned.

I am even more perplexed by His Eternal Splendor forgiving the Archons for their actions when they were manipulated by the Kemeroi into aiding the attempted release of their hound, the "Hopeslayer". Such a beast is dangerous to this world. I can only imagine there are plans within plans far outside my humble understanding.')

Soon, I am assured, we will find the way to best control them, and then they will be an impressive weapon indeed. I do hope my Battle Lord, Gregor does not fail me in this. The upstart Isparians may manage to disperse him occasionally, but what I''ll do to him if he fails me will make their interruptions look like a blessed reprieve.')

He has found a means of both peering into the future and manipulating what He sees. With this knowledge He has changed the path of this world to move away from some "Golden Age" the Isparians sought to create, as if they could ever know true prosperity being led by a stripling of a girl who got lucky trying to kill an overstuffed insect... This was the true purpose behind the Apostate manipulations, as well as the plans set in motion in these frozen halls.')

Trust and Love... I''ve lost count of how many fools fell relying on such... untrustworthy emotions. His Eternal Splendor is truly gifted in His foresight.');
