Branwyn and I had an argument earlier this day. My father is growing more sickly with each passing day and soon will reach the point where not even a lifestone could revive him. I want to move to Glenden Wood to be near him during what may be his final days. But Branwyn, so wrapped up in her market stand, doesn''t want to leave Arwic for fear of the lack of income. Glenden Wood stands to be a very profitable town, I know of several allegiances that call it home. I doubt she would miss a pyreal there. But alas she')

After our argument, I promptly left the cottage and made my way to Glenden Wood to visit father. Aunt Wyna does good looking after him, but I am sure she would like a reprieve once in a while. I brought father his monougat (Auntie Wyna would skin me had she seen me sneak him those) and the most recent Crier''s Ballot to read. Home bound as he is, he relishes the opportunity to hear of the world.')

I worked my way west along the Lost Wish ridge where I ran across some comrades from Arwic who were hunting mattekars for their fur trade. They invited me to stay the night at their cottage in Colier View Hill. The small cottage was crowded but the fire was cozy and the company')

Journey Log 2

Biding my friends farewell, I embarked north towards MacDugal''s stronghold. Normally I avoid that sort, but I was short on bandages, and an adventurer never enters the wilds without his healing kits.

My thoughts drifted to Branwyn as I passed one of the Tremblant standing stones. I had brought her there three years ago, just before we married. We camped on the hill behind the stone and watched')

I took my midday meal at the border of the blighted lands and the end of the Lost Wish mountains. The Olthoi have done horrible things to that land. There are only but a few pristine locations left in that valley, though those are often guarded by things worse than Olthoi.')
