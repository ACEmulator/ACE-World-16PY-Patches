Using many previously existing oils, along with a couple newly created oils and a set of specially crafted Phials (Available exclusively from Janier al-Evv), a number of combat effective and throwable phials may be created.

The Phials are made from the same materials used in the crafting of Spell Scarabs, and have a similar effect on the resulting power and delicacy of the Phial. Now, interestingly enough, due to the unique alchemical nature of Lead, Enchanted Lead Phials could not be created. Because of this, there are no base versions of the final Phials, utilizing effects similar to the lowest tier of Life Magics. Similarly, something in the nature of the magics of the 7th tier also have, at present, proven to be impossible to replicate. I believe the power of the magics themselves may be too complex to be contained through the alchemical methods I employ to make the Phials.

An important note about this process: The Phials get more delicate the more powerful they are, and also are more difficult to use. It takes a skilled hand in Alchemy to both create the final, throw-able phials, and to use them in the field. Remember this, as it is very important. If you are not an Alchemist, you will not be able to use these Phials. On the other hand, if you can craft the Phial, chances are you can use it. There is some discrepancy in this, as to wield the phial, you will need the skill to create the phial without a mage artificially enhancing your skill at Alchemy. Be warned.

Her assistance is greatly appreciated in this endeavor.

With this enchantment, the Phial''s accuracy is unmatched, but not absolute. A trained skill with thrown weapons never hurts, especially when throwing phials at a creature will most likely anger it.

Also, be warned that all of the Phials are fragile, and you will need to protect it from breakage should you be attacked while holding one. Dodging about in melee will be notably harder while wielding a Phial in combat.
