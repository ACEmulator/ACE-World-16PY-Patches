Here are my first rough observations after an extensive reconnaissance of the Viamontian fortifications. I have scouted four forts around Zaikhal, each of them meant to be a launching point for the assault on the city. They have delved deep underground, with the assistance of renegade Lugians. They have completed a portal transport network with the assistance of Virindi. In short, the Viamontian King has struck up two powerful alliances in relatively short order.')

These knights seem to be responsible for the maintenance of the creatures known as "Eaters" - horrible, slavering beasts capable of chewing through the stoutest plate armor. I gather these beasts will be used as front-line assault weapons, preceding the Knight legions into battle. The leader of the Copper Legion is Captain Ramelle, who seems to be the most junior of the invasion commanders.')

The Virindi have helped the Viamontians with their portal network, and I have had difficulty figuring out which faction of Virindi is truly involved. Blame it on the inscrutability of those hovering masks, whom it seems I have spent my entire life spying upon, and have left me plenty of sickle-shaped scars and lightning burns to remember them by.')

The Platinum Legion boasts the toughest soldiers of the invasion, and Captain Balanchi has been entrusted with the supply chain back to Viamont - all of the weapons and armor for use in the invasion, as well as the treasure meant to buy the services of their allies, pass through the hands of Captain Balanchi first.')

I am not so much of a fool as to try and take one of these soldiers down to investigate it for myself.

Corcima has one odd habit, which he displayed during his visit. He actually cut himself and smeared some of his own blood on the helm of his soldiers! I know Viamontians place great stock in the power of blood, especially royal blood, but I do not know what purpose the blood serves.')

I would be quite interested to see what kind of armor you could make if only you could inspect a piece of Corcima''s suit.');
