First, I would like to share some good news with you: brave and loyal Isparians have obtained Shade Iron ore samples from Varicci''s mines on the southwestern coast. We made sure to only recruit those who have proven their loyalty to the rebels of Silyun. Now that we have obtained samples, we can proceed with our plans. Soon, we will be able to sabotage the Viamontians'' research, and perhaps retaliate in kind against the murderer Varicci.')

I expect that the guidance of Tharnoch and his soldiers will help turn the tide against the Viamontian assault on Dereth.')

We may actually be able to turn this situation to our advantage, though it requires that you and your garrison serve as a sort of trap.')

You will likely need Hashina''s cooperation in this, to direct Viamontian spies your way. She would be a likely contact point for any potential infiltrators. Should any of Varicci''s spies enter your domain, you have my permission to capture them and glean from them whatever information you can.');
