The information provided by our new "allies" of the Rossu Morta showed us a different and more effective path.  As soon as we analyzed Dardante''s research notes, we were able to re-focus our energies, and I am confident we are on the correct path to Grael.

We must concentrate on Grael.  We can worry about vengeance when we have joined ourselves to the Black Spear.
