The Fansin clan had contracted the services of a house of Nanjou Shou-Jen whose name has since been lost to time. With the support of this unnamed assassin clan, the Fansin won victory after victory and began to rapidly conquer the forts and villages of the Kosu clan. All of this changed when, under cover of night, the Fansin''s assassins murdered an entire village in the heart of the Kosu lands and razed the village.')

They even went so far as to desecrate the corpses of the murdered villagers before burning them. In the Tanada clan''s beliefs, the spirits of the slain of the village were so outraged by this barbarism that they appeared before the last survivor of the village, who was a simple gardener tending the plum trees at the Kosu palace. Born by a black wind blowing from the west, they descended upon young Tanada Hano while he was tearfully praying at a makeshift shrine for his murdered kin.')

That night, he went forth from the shrine, wreathed in the black energies of vengeful spirits, his hands transformed into the claws of demons. He stalked into the hidden base of the clan that had wiped out his village and killed every assassin he found there. After that, he somehow managed to move a hundred leagues to the palace of the Fansins and slaughtered every adult of the family, sparing only children too young to fight and one pregnant woman.')

He was naked and disoriented, with the white jade pendant of Fansin Hanu clutched in his blood-caked hands. He had no memories of the previous night, except recollections of a transforming rage, and the screams of dying men. He claimed he could not possibly be responsible for the slaughter of the Fansins and their assassins, as he had been in the Kosu orchard so far from the Fansin estate. A few days later, however, he was identified by the survivors of the Fansin massacre, who fearfully renounced all claims of vengeance against him or the Kosu.')

By this point other clans of the Nanjou Shou-Jen had existed for thousands of years, and did not take kindly to this sudden and indiscreet appearance of a rival family. One by one they sent their most skilled killers after him, and one by one each killer''s head was returned with a polite, almost regretful note from Tanada Hano.')

In addition, he took up acolytes from the most low and humble farming families in the area, adopting them as full members of the Tanada family.

The warlords of the Kosu have lived in a sort of superstitious dread of the Tanada ever since the days of the demonic rampage of the quiet and gentle Tanada Hano. Since the independent killings never conflicted with Kosu interests, and seemed to bless the Kosu themselves with a patina of bloody righteousness by association, they were content to let the Tanada operate as they saw fit.')

The warlord of the Kosu family at the time, Kosu Tokou, was a man of prodigious and illicit appetites. He took a concubine with a fearful reputation. She was whispered to be a sorceress trained in the dark arts of Milantos. Not long after he took up this concubine the lord began to change. Tokou had always been dishonest and prone to heavy drinking, but he soon developed a taste for torture and cruelty. A crucial moment came when Tokou and his concubine ordered a young Tanada assassin to demonstrate a rare and closely guarded killing technique upon a child that Tokou had taken from one of his own farming villages.')

Almost the entire clan chose to comply with the suicide that their warlord demanded. A handful of proud and defiant Tanada, however, fled the temple and managed to evade the soldiers of the Kosu.')

Three years after the death of his concubine, Kosu Tokou died as well. He was found dead in his bed, with an expression of abject terror on his face. His body was unmarked, but his organs, when his surgeons cut him open to divine the nature of his death, were black and rotten.')

Proceed with caution, because the Tanada seem to have lost their way. They have cut themselves off from the principles and loyalties that kept them disciplined. Treat them as a band of superbly trained murderers. We do not know yet what role they will make for themselves here on Dereth.');
