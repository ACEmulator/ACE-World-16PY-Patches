I commend you for getting to this third and final step.

I know that there is someone or some thing out there that seeks to do me harm and seeks to harm the human realm of Dereth through me.')

As with the other two notes, you will have to match each letter in my cipher text in sequence with the numbers I provided the note I left with Bretself. Shift the letter down a number of spots corresponding to the number that letter is paired with, and that should leave you with the "true text" letter.')
