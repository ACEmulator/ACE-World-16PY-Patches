They call themselves the Ruschk. That much we got right. But what we never understood was just how powerful - and how intelligent - they really are. They cannot speak our language.

Somehow, they''ve found a way to allow this god to possess the body of their greatest warrior, a Ruschk they call Kresch.

I don''t know what Tursh really is. I don''t know if he actually is a god or if he''s just some long-dead Ruschk who refuses to leave this plane of existence. I don''t know, and I don''t much care.

Good luck, my friend. And whatever they offer you, remember - you cannot trust these fiends.');
