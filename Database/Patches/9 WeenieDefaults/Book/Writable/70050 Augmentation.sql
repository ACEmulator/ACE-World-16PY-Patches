It did not take them long to find me, cowering amongst the ice-covered trees. I would like to say I put up more of a fight. I would like to say that I tried with all my might to rescue Eleonora and Sir Bellas from King''s forces, but I am no soldier. This has always been true of me, and it is true to this day.')

When they captured me, they took me to their torture chambers. I had heard the stories. I knew of what they were capable. I fully expected to end my days flayed alive or pinned within the iron maiden. But no, they had another fate for me.')

It is due to the two of them that I am able to function at all.

He screamed, oh how he screamed.

The magics twisted him. They warped his mind as well as his flesh. He was already a large man to begin with, but these magics increased his size fivefold.')

I do not know what slip the mages made. I don''t know how he was freed from his magical bonds, but I saw it happen. I saw as he realized that he was free. And I saw the mages panic as they realized it, too.

They tried to re-cast the binding spell, but he was too fast. They made him that way.')

He slung the dead mage''s body at the others. He was upon them as they fell to the ground, ripping and tearing. Limbs were pulled from sockets, heads from necks. Gone was the skilled, calculating warrior I had served for so many years.')

I would like to say that before he fled the chamber he exchanged some small look of recognition with me. But no, that did not happen. His mind was shattered. He was no longer the brave and noble Sir Bellas. He was now a wild thing, full of bloodlust and savagery.

He fled the torture chamber. I heard the screams as he tore through the guards above. I heard as he smashed through their cages and escaped our dank prison.')

No, now is not the time. Perhaps I will write of them later. Or, if I am lucky, they will simply fade from memory.

Yes, that would be nice.');
