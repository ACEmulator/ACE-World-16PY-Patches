    - Delay: 0.5, Tell: This isn't enough to directly tie Nuhmudira to the theft of Lunnum, but I may be able to use this to scry for places this note has been.
    - Delay: 0.5, DirectBroadcast: Layeel holds the recipe to his chest and slowly turns around chanting something unintelligible beneath his breath. His eyes grow hazy and unfocused and he slows to a stop facing east.

    - Delay: 0.5, Tell: I have scryed a strong connection to a place located in the eastern end of the Osteth Mountain Range. Travel to 84.3N 24.7E and seek out what lies there.
    - Delay: 0.5, Tell: I have one more favor to ask of you. If you find that Lunnum's corpse has been desecrated in any way I would have you destroy it rather than see it returned to Fiun Gaya in such a state. Better that he never sees such a sight.

            - Delay: 0.5, Tell: Thank you for finally finding what became of Lunnum. Do no tell Fiun Gaya of her undeath, I fear he would be unable to deal with the truth. It is better he should keep the pyre burning in her memory. Perhaps you could visit him and provide him some solace by helping him keep his pyre.

            - Delay: 0.5, Tell: I wish that you had not killed that innocent man Andrilos. May you take this as a lesson that people should not be judged without a sound body of evidence. Vigilantism is blood thirst masquerading as justice.
