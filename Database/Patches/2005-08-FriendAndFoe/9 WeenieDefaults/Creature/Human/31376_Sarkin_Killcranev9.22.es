	- Delay: 1.5, Tell: May Grael taste the fear of the forces he has brought down upon himself. You have proven yourself worthy of joining the ancient and honorable Knights of the Golden Flame.

	- Delay: 1.5, Tell: Where did you happen across this fascinating literature? ... some new islands you say? Most intriguing.
	- Delay: 1.5, Tell: The Order of the Raven Hand have been searching for the same creature mentioned in this book. I find it somewhat disturbing that so many references to this being have popped up so rapidly.
	- Delay: 1.5, Tell: Something is in motion here. Moving faster than I would like. Very worrisome indeed.

Give: Vestibule Lock (31381)
	- TurnToTarget
	- Delay: 1.5, Tell: So many adventurers have brought me pieces of this item, and it is only now that I see it completed that I remember where I've seen it before.
	- Delay: 1.5, Tell: You've been to the Soul Crystal Vaults, correct? You know - Fenmalain, Caulnalain, Shendolain, those three. Each house a gate that requires a key. Looking at this, it appears to be part of one such gate. Yet... this one is on the Singularity Caul.
	- Delay: 1.5, Tell: With this lock in our hands, we can assume that one such gate exists on the Singularity Caul, likely in an incomplete state.
	- Delay: 1.5, Tell: We know that these gates guarded some of the scattered pieces of the Crystal Array that were used to contain the essence of the Hopeslayer. It is not so far fetched to think that other similar arrays were created to contain other horrors.
	- Delay: 1.5, Tell: Wait... now this is odd... no offense to you, but it seems as though you put this together incorrectly. I've spent a good deal of time studying the gates; I should be of some help here.
	- Delay: 1.5, Tell: Here! Now go and seek out this new Shadow gate on the Singularity Caul. Infiltrate the dark places the gate will lead you to. I have heard tell of yet another concentration of Raven Hand forces in the northern reaches of that accursed place.

	- TurnToTarget
	- Delay: 1.5, DirectBroadcast: Killcrane gently unlocks the sealed translation and quickly skims the bulk of Kuyiza bint Zayi's translation.
	- Delay: 1.5, Tell: A dericost text...Kuyiza always manages to come through on these types of artifacts.
	- Delay: 1.5, Tell: Judging from her translation, this seems to be an account of some creature. Something powerful and driven by the darkness. The text does't do very well to describe it physically, merely stating that this creature could bring out the fear in those it fought.
	- Delay: 1.5, Tell: It was a beast of grand stature. Those it confronted were felled in the conflict or driven mad with fear.
	- Delay: 1.5, Tell: If the Raven Hand has managed to release something, or weaken the bonds that hold it, I fear we must act quickly.
	- Delay: 1.5, Tell: For now, it appears my search is at a halt. Whatever the goal of the Raven Hand on the Singularity Caul , it seems as though they have achieved it.

	- Delay: 1.5, Tell: Ah the infamous High Archon Kraest...hmm? You haven't heard of him before now? I suppose you wouldn't, few outside the Raven Hand know of him, and those who do are likely ones such as myself.
	- Delay: 1.5, Tell: This journal contains Kraest's notes. his goal seems to be to unleash some trapped essence associated with the darkness. The text gives a better description of what exactly the being is...better than the Dericost texts I have managed to get my hands upon recently.
	- Delay: 1.5, Tell: Kraest calls the being "the Spear of the Mukkir". I can't say as I have heard of such a thing before. Though from what he has written, it is apparently a vicious and frightening creature.
	- Delay: 1.5, Tell: It is clear from this journal that Kraest accomplished what he sought to do on the Singularity Caul. He shattered the first crystal he believes to be keeping the creature at bay.
