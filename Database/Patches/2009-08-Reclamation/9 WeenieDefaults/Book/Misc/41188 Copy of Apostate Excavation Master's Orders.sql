Before the Primus could depart again through its own means, the insectoid invaders, the Olthoi, interrupted all Empyrean activity and caused Asheron to shut down his portals.  The Primus and its followers were stranded here and soon fell victim to the assaults of the Olthoi and normative entropy, and their remnants were buried before the Quiddity became aware of this world.
