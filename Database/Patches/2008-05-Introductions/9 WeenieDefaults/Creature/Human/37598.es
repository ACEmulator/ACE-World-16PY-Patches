    - Tell: Young Temo's note tells me that you helped him recover the scepter of Menilesh... We thank you for your devotion and your interest in the glories of ages long past. Perhaps, in time, you can join the Eldrytch Web and do your part to bring those glories back to Dereth, from the ruins and forgotten memories of the present day. We are not accepting new members now, but your assistance in this matter has been noted, and will not be forgotten. We will watch you with interest from this day forward. For now, perhaps you would wish to look through this book and learn some more about the Eldrytch Web.
