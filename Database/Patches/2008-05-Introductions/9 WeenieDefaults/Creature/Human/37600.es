Give: Radiant Blood Letter of Introduction (80302)
    - Tell: I see you have been of use to one of my scouts. That Jawaq always was a little weak in the sword arm, if you know what I mean. Well, if you did what he could not, perhaps, in time, you may be useful to me. The Radiant Blood is not accepting more members yet, but we may in the not-too-distant future... Suffice it to say you have been noticed, and may be watched. For now, allow me to present you with a book on the tenets of our society to see if your heart belongs with us.
