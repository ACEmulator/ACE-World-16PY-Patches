							- Delay: 0.5 Tell: I can smell the touch of the Light upon you. This is good. That touch can give those determined enough to use it great strength.
							- Delay: 0.5 Tell: The Light is what chose me, of all my sisters, to be the Seer of the Dark Falatacot.
							- Delay: 0.5 Tell: Do you find it strange that one such as myself can still touch the Light, let alone wield it? It is not. The blood of the Empyrean still flows through these long-dead veins. It is the call of blood to which the Light speaks.
							- Delay: 0.5 Tell: It is by that power that I can set you upon the same Path that I walked, so very long ago, and then use that shared bond to empower you.
							- Delay: 0.5 Tell: If this is your desire, then give to me one of these new tradenotes of yours. I believe it is called an 'MMD Note', and I will set your feet upon the Path.
				QuestFailure:
