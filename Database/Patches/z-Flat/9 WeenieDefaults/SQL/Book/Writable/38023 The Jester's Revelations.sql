If I had not sought to interfere in the struggle of the nobles, if I had been content to be the Fool in service to a House that was virtuous, but doomed to die, perhaps we would all be better off.

I told him I would lead him to my master''s location, betray his secrets, if he would grant me the power afforded by that unholy book, whose name I will not even write down. Make me a godling, I told him, and he could have the Mhoires. It was my intent to use my new powers to foil their plans and save the Mhoires from imperial revenge. Lord Rytheran agreed, more easily than I anticipated. I planned to betray him, just as he, as I found out, planned to betray me. And in the end, we were all betrayed by forces beyond our comprehension, and ultimately by our own arrogance. ')

He read a page to me, and I could, indeed, feel incredible power flowing into me, like a river running high and wild in the rainy season. It was too much for any mortal to contain. With the promised power and eternal life came a curse of growing madness, an inability to control the chaotic power within me. It was all I could do just to keep from destroying myself and everything around me, and my control was slipping. I could feel the malevolent will of the book like a living thing, coiled around me, hungering and waiting for my will to give out. ')

He told me he could sense the presence of Rytheran and the book itself through me. That I had become Rytheran''s unwitting weapon and delivered myself exactly where he wanted me, into the heart of the Mhoire sanctum, with the book''s vile powers bleeding chaos across his polished marble floors, a beacon to those who had made use of the book.

Doom came to us all that day, though not all of us realized it. The House of Mhoire was cursed to the very undeath that they sought to avoid, and their estate destroyed and trapped in a hellish grave-realm of Rytheran''s making. I gained a share of their torment, with them yet separated from them, truly the worst of both bargains. And Lord Rytheran, in using the book on me and upon the Mhoires, fell prey to the whispered blandishments of the book. Rytheran was already a damned and evil creature, tainted by the stolen blood magic of savage Falatacot priestesses. But the book, given an opening, became part of him, as it is now part of me... ')

It is a voice of destruction, corruption, and madness. It seeks a way out into the world, to suck the life from our land as I once delighted in squeezing the juice from a ripe fruit. I know that this island of Killiakta is an island both cursed and blessed, and it is a crossroads of immensely powerful forces. The voice has plans for this land, and for me. Lord Rytheran''s misjudgment, made possible by my own arrogance, has created an opening to be exploited. Forgive me. Forgive us all. I fear we cannot forgive ourselves. ');
