Melee warriors of all disciplines should be most interested to know that this unique item is a long-forgotten crystalline shield known as an Aegis.

As fate would have it, the chorizite fused with the crystal in a way I would have never expected!  The Aegis seemed lighter, almost transparent in a way. It was as if the crystal did not physically exist anymore.  But it was still there, I could see and touch it, and it still retained some weight.

Our initial results indicate that the aura generated by the Aegis is a protective one, and will partially absorb the energy from a magical bolt.  I use the word partially, because we have not yet been able to extensively test the properties of magic absorbtion.
