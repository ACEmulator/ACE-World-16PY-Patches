Levistras, in its human-derived impatience, sought to build a New Singularity from imperfect materials.

We have determined that the mechanical entities sent a diplomatic envoy, known as a Primus, to this world to treat with the Empyrean sorcerer Asheron shortly after he opened his crude portal connections between worlds.  Before the Primus could depart again through its own means, the insectoid invaders, the Olthoi, interrupted all Empyrean activity and caused Asheron to shut down his portals.  The Primus and its followers were stranded here and soon fell victim to the assaults of the Olthoi and normative entropy, and their remnants were buried before the Quiddity became aware of this world.

Until we know more of the mechanical entities and where they come from, you must maintain the secrecy of your facility against the constant interference of the meatling allies of Asheron.
