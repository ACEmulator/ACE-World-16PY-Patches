Use this batch file to combine all the sql scripts into one, ACE-World-CE16PY.sql, for easier importing.

The resulting "compiled" script will drop any existing SQL database named "ace_world", recreate it 
and fill it with the data as it was around February 2005, known ingame as Coldeve 16 P.Y. or the Infiltration patch.

Note that importing this script into your SQL server will take a significantly longer amount of time
than the script(s) found in the releases section of this git repo, as this script is NOT optimized in any form.
